# Roll-a-Ball-Unity
This game is created using Unity Engine .The objective of the game is to roll a ball inside a box and collect all the available boxes. The boxes should simulate a rotation animation, capturing the attention of the player. Each time the ball hits a box one point should be awarded to the player, a “cashier” sound effect played, and then that box should disappear from the scene.
